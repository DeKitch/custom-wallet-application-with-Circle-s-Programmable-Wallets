Freelancer Club: Your All-in-One Gig Work Powerhouse (USDC & Programmable Wallets)
Tired of chasing late payments and navigating international fees? Freelancer Club is here to revolutionize the freelance life! This mobile app uses the magic of USDC (a stablecoin) and Circle's Programmable Wallets to make payments between freelancers and clients secure, fast, and totally automated.

Here's the deal:

Freelancers: Simply create your account, connect your Circle Programmable Wallet (think secure digital piggy bank), and set your rates in USDC. No more worrying about exchange rates – USDC stays steady! The app even generates a unique payment address for easy transactions.
Clients: Sign up, link your funding source (bank account, debit card), and load up your USDC balance. Then, browse awesome freelancer profiles and find the perfect fit for your project.
Ready to get started?

Post a Project: Freelancers, list your skills, project timelines, and rates in USDC. Let the world know what you're amazing at!
Secure Escrow: When a client hires you, they deposit the project funds in USDC into a secure escrow within your Circle Programmable Wallet. Don't worry, the money stays locked until you complete agreed-upon milestones.
Automated Milestones: Imagine magic money fairies automatically releasing payments! Using smart contracts (fancy code wizards), the app automatically sends you USDC as you hit project milestones (e.g., finishing design mockups, delivering code). No more chasing invoices!
Dispute Resolution: Things not quite right? The app has a built-in system for mediating disagreements. Your USDC stays safe in escrow until everything's resolved.
Seamless Payments: Get paid instantly in USDC directly to your wallet. No waiting for bank transfers or international fees. Need local currency? Easily convert USDC or spend it anywhere that accepts USDC!
